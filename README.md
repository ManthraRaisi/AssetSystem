5.2 Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Angular, or Vue.js.
 - **Backend**: Node.js, Django, or ASP.NET Core.
 - **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL for structured data
 - **Hosting**: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
6. Integration Requirements
- Integration with third-party accounting tools (e.g., QuickBooks, SAP). - Support for Single Sign-On (SSO) and LDAP for user authentication. - API for custom integrations with internal tools.
7. Risks and Assumptions
7.1 Risks
- Data breaches due to sensitive asset information. - Budget overruns during development.
7.2 Assumptions
- Users will have basic digital literacy. - The company has sufficient IT infrastructure for hosting.
8. Development Plan
- **Phase 1**: Requirements gathering and prototyping.
 - **Phase 2**: Core functionality development.
- **Phase 3**: Testing and deployment.
- **Phase 4**: User training and system handover.
9. Conclusion
This document provides a foundation for developing a robust Asset Management System. It aims to address the company's operational needs while ensuring scalability and security.
Additional Details
